# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
The **Python 1000 Snippets** repository supports Python 3.8 and above. Security updates will be applied to the latest snippets and documentation as needed.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in any of the snippets or the repository, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do Not Open a Public Issue**: To protect users, avoid disclosing vulnerabilities publicly until they are resolved.
2. **Contact the Maintainers**:
   - Email: izeno.contact@gmail.com
   - Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and potential impact.
3. **Response Time**:
   - We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
   - We aim to resolve and release fixes within 7 days for critical issues.
4. **Disclosure**:
   - Once resolved, we will credit you (if desired) in the release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Best Practices
- Ensure dependencies (e.g., `numpy`, `scipy`) are up-to-date to avoid known vulnerabilities.
- Avoid running untrusted snippets in production environments.
- Follow the guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for secure coding practices.

Thank you for helping keep **Python 1000 Snippets** secure!
