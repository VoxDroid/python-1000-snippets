# Nash Equilibrium

## Description
This snippet demonstrates finding a Nash equilibrium in a 2x2 game.

## Code
```python
import numpy as np
payoff = np.array([[[3, 3], [0, 5]], [[5, 0], [1, 1]]])  # Prisoner's Dilemma
nash = None
for i in range(2):
    for j in range(2):
        if (payoff[i, j, 0] >= payoff[1-i, j, 0] and 
            payoff[i, j, 1] >= payoff[i, 1-j, 1]):
            nash = (i, j)
print("Nash Equilibrium:", nash)
```

## Output
```
Nash Equilibrium: (1, 1)
```

## Explanation
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Identifies strategy pairs where neither player benefits by changing their strategy, assuming the other player’s choice remains fixed.
- **Logic**: Checks each combination of player strategies to see if both players are choosing their best response to the other's strategy (mutual best response).
- **Complexity**: O(n^2) for n strategies per player, as it checks every possible strategy combination.
- **Use Case**: Helps analyze stable and predictable outcomes in competitive games.
- **Best Practice**: Handle mixed strategies (randomized choices); validate payoffs; check for multiple Nash equilibria (pure or mixed).
