# Hello World

## Description
This snippet demonstrates the simplest Python program that outputs the classic "Hello, World!" message to the console. It introduces the basic syntax of Python and the `print()` function, which is commonly used for displaying text.

## Code
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Output
```
Hello, World!
```

## Explanation
- **Purpose**: The "Hello, World!" program is a traditional first step in learning any programming language. It verifies that the Python environment is set up correctly and introduces the programmer to basic output.
- **`print()` Function**: The `print()` function takes a string (in this case, `"Hello, World!"`) and displays it in the console. The quotation marks (`"`) denote a string literal.
- **Syntax**: Python uses simple, readable syntax. No semicolons or complex boilerplate code are needed, unlike some other languages.
- **Use Case**: This is often used to test a Python installation or as an entry point for beginners to understand output in programming.
